            <p>
                I'm Alfonso Pruneda-Suarez. My friends call me
                "Fonzie", and it just kind of stuck. I'm a Frontend Developer
                based in the United States that loves to code and build products
                with a pleasant user experience. The current technologies I'm most
                familiar with are HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.
                Interested in working together? I'd love to hear from you.
                Feel free to reach out by email or through any of my socials.
